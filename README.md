<h1>ZevenApp</h1>

Use **WhatsApp** on your old iOS 7+ device
<p><em>"Zeven" means "seven" in Flemish</em></p>

</div>

## Usage
This section is split in two parts: the **app** and the **companion server**

#### Server
ZevenApp requires you to host your own server because of the way it interfaces with WhatsApp. We cannot directly contact the WhatsApp servers from the app, and as such it needs a "middleman". You can either selfhost it at home, or get a cheap server to do it on.<br>
<sub>*No, it is most likely not possible to remove this requirement. Please do not ask about it.*</sub>

#### Guide
- Install Bun
- Go to Server/ and run `bun build server.ts utils.ts chat.ts --compile`. Add build target & any other flags if needed.
- Download FFmpeg from:
  * Windows: https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds/releases/download/latest/ffmpeg-master-latest-win64-lgpl.zip
  * macOS: https://evermeet.cx/ffmpeg/
  * Linux: https://johnvansickle.com/ffmpeg/
- Create `bin` folder in the folder that has the newly made executable
- Move the `ffmpeg` binary and its dependencies from the previously downloaded archive into that `bin` folder
- Run `server` and profit.

#### App
The app is fairly easy to get running as long as you properly set up the server with the instructions above.

#### Guide
- Get the latest build from the releases section on this repository or compile it yourself from source
- Install it on your iDevice
- Set your server IP address/domain on the setup screen and scan the QR code to link your WhatsApp account
- Keep your device open and wait for the chats to load
